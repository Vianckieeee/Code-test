  Explanation:
  The cities array contains objects, each representing a city with properties name and population.

  The for...of loop is used to iterate over each element (city object) in the cities array.
  The loop variable city represents each city object in each iteration.

  Within the loop, there's an if statement that checks whether the population of the current city (city.population) 
  is greater than 20 million (20e6 is scientific notation for 20 million).

  If the condition is true (population > 20 million), information about the city is printed to the console using console.log.
