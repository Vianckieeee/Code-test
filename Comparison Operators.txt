Comparison operators in JavaScript are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them. They return a Boolean (true or false) result, indicating whether the comparison is true or false. Here are the commonly used comparison operators and how they work:

1. **Equal (`==`):**
   - Checks if the values on both sides are equal. It performs type coercion, meaning it converts data types if they are different before comparison.
   - Example: `3 == '3'` is `true` because JavaScript converts the string `'3'` to a number and then checks if `3` equals `3`.

2. **Not Equal (`!=`):**
   - Checks if the values on both sides are not equal. It also performs type coercion.
   - Example: `5 != '2'` is `true` because `5` is not equal to `'2'`.

3. **Strict Equal (`===`):**
   - Checks if the values on both sides are equal and of the same data type. It does not perform type coercion.
   - Example: `4 === 4` is `true`, but `4 === '4'` is `false`.

4. **Strict Not Equal (`!==`):**
   - Checks if the values on both sides are not equal or are of different data types. It does not perform type coercion.
   - Example: `5 !== 3` is `true`, and `5 !== '5'` is also `true`.

5. **Greater Than (`>`):**
   - Checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.
   - Example: `7 > 4` is `true` because 7 is greater than 4.

6. **Less Than (`<`):**
   - Checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.
   - Example: `3 < 9` is `true` because 3 is less than 9.

7. **Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`):**
   - Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.
   - Example: `6 >= 6` is `true` because 6 is equal to 6.

8. **Less Than or Equal To (`<=`):**
   - Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.
   - Example: `5 <= 8` is `true` because 5 is less than 8.

Comparison operators are commonly used in conditional statements (like `if` statements) and loops to make decisions based on the relationships between values. They help you control the flow of your code and perform different actions based on the conditions you specify.
